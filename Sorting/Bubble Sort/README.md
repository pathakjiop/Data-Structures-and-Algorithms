## **Introduction**  
Bubble Sort is a simple **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly steps through an array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top (beginning) of the array, while larger elements "sink" to the bottom (end).

- **Stability**: Bubble Sort is **stable** (does not change the order of equal elements).  
- **In-Place**: Uses constant extra space (**O(1)**).  
- **Adaptive**: Can be optimized to terminate early if the list becomes sorted.

## **How Bubble Sort Works**  
1. **Passes**: The algorithm makes multiple passes through the array.  
2. **Comparisons**: In each pass, adjacent elements are compared.  
3. **Swaps**: If elements are out of order, they are swapped.  
4. **Termination**: The process repeats until no swaps are needed in a full pass.  

---

## **Algorithm Steps**  
1. Start with the first element (index 0).  
2. Compare it with the next element (index 1).  
3. If the first element is greater, swap them.  
4. Move to the next pair (index 1 and 2).  
5. Repeat until the end of the array.  
6. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is placed at the end.  
7. Reduce the array length by 1 and repeat until sorted.

## **Java Implementation**  
### Basic Bubble Sort  
```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                // Compare adjacent elements
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap elements
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        bubbleSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}
```

### Optimized Bubble Sort  
Adds a flag to check if any swaps occurred in a pass.  
```java
public static void optimizedBubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    boolean swapped;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        swapped = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        // If no swaps, array is sorted
        if (!swapped) break;
    }
}
```

## **Pros and Cons**  
### ✔️ **Pros**  
- Simple to understand and implement.  
- No extra memory required (in-place).  
- Stable and adaptive (with optimization).  

### ❌ **Cons**  
- Extremely inefficient for large datasets.  
- Rarely used in practice for real-world problems.

## **Use Cases**  
- Small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.  
- Educational purposes to introduce sorting algorithms.  
- Embedded systems with limited memory.

## **Step-by-Step Example**  
**Input Array**: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`  
**Pass 1**:  
- Compare 5 and 3 → Swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`  
- Compare 5 and 8 → No swap  
- Compare 8 and 4 → Swap → `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`  
- Compare 8 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`  

**Pass 2**:  
- Compare 3 and 5 → No swap  
- Compare 5 and 4 → Swap → `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`  
- Compare 5 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`  

**Pass 3**:  
- Compare 3 and 4 → No swap  
- Compare 4 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`  

**Pass 4**:  
- Compare 3 and 2 → Swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`  

**Sorted Array**: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`

## **Visual Explanation**  
```
Initial: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]  
Pass 1: [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]  
Pass 2: [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]  
Pass 3: [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]  
Pass 4: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]  
```

## **Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms**  
| Algorithm     | Best Case | Avg/Worst Case | Space | Stable | Adaptive |  
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|----------|  
| **Bubble Sort** | O(n)      | O(n²)          | O(1)  | Yes    | Yes      |  
| **Quick Sort**  | O(n log n)| O(n²)          | O(n)  | No     | No       |  
| **Merge Sort**  | O(n log n)| O(n log n)     | O(n)  | Yes    | No       |

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**  
1. **Incorrect Loop Bounds**:  
   - Outer loop runs `n-1` times, not `n`.  
   - Inner loop runs `n-i-1` times.  

2. **Forgetting Optimization**:  
   - Always include the `swapped` flag to skip unnecessary passes.  

3. **Swapping Without a Temporary Variable**:  
   - In Java, use a `temp` variable:  
     ```java
     int temp = arr[j];
     arr[j] = arr[j+1];
     arr[j+1] = temp;
     ```
